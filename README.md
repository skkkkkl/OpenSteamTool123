## Feature

### Core Unlocks
- Unlock an unlimited number of unowned games.
- Unlock all DLCs for unowned games.
- Support auto load depot decryption keys from Lua config.
- Support auto manifest download via `manifestdex` / `opensteamtool` / `steamrun` / `wudrm` upstream APIs (default is `manifestdex`), or a custom Lua endpoint (see [Manifest via Lua](#manifest-via-lua)).
- Support downloading protected games or DLCs that require an access token.
- Support binding manifest to prevent specific games from being updated.

### Hot Reload
- Adding, modifying, deleting, or overwriting `.lua` files in any watched directory automatically triggers a reload. No restart, no offline/online toggle needed.

### Injection
- Load third-party DLLs into game processes through `[[inject]]` in `opensteamtool.toml`. See [Third-party DLL injection](#third-party-dll-injection).

### Family Sharing and Remote Play
- Bypass Steam Family Sharing restrictions with zero configuration.

### Compatible with games protected by Denuvo and SteamStub
- SteamStub-only games do not require configuring `AppTicket`. OpenSteamTool forges the requested AppId using Steam's local ConfigStore ticket, without injecting into the game process.
- Denuvo-protected games require credential data. Credentials are stored under `<Steam or Portable Dir>/config/credentials/<AppId>/` (`AppTicket.bin`, `ETicket.bin`, `SteamID.txt`), no longer in the Windows Registry.
- **Explicit Tickets**: Use `setAppTicket(appid, "hex")` and `setETicket(appid, "hex")` in Lua config. `AppTicket` inherently contains the owner's SteamID; configuring `SteamID.txt` is **not** required when using explicit tickets. Deleting the Lua script automatically cleans up this directory.
- **Account Switching Offline Auth**: When an account owning the game launches online and passes verification, OpenSteamTool automatically saves its `SteamID.txt`. Simply switch to an account without the game.
- **SteamID Priority & Error 54**: The SteamID embedded in `AppTicket` takes priority; if no explicit ticket exists, `SteamID.txt` is used. A mismatch between the SteamID and ticket causes Denuvo Error 54 (`k_EResultDiskFull`).
- Denuvo tokens may expire or be bound to hardware. If launch fails with Denuvo error `88500005`, re-extract and refresh the ticket data in the Lua config.

### Extracting Tickets & Config with `extract_tickets`

The `extract_tickets` tool extracts authorization tickets (`AppTicket` / `ETicket`), owned DLCs, PICS access tokens (`AccessToken`), and cached manifest files (`*.manifest`) for games you own, generating a ready-to-use `<appid>.lua` config.

* **Download**: Available from the [GitHub Actions Tools Workflow](https://github.com/mmxlyo/OpenSteamTool/actions/workflows/tools.yml).
* **Usage**:
  Run it while Steam is running and logged into an account that owns the target game (pass the AppId or enter when prompted):
  ```powershell
  extract_tickets.exe 1361510
  ```
* **Output** (saved in the `<appid>/` directory):
  * `<appid>.lua` — Complete, ready-to-use config (including AppId, owned DLCs, access tokens via `addtoken`, depot keys, pinned manifests via `setManifestid`, and tickets). Copy directly to `config/lua/`.
  * `*.manifest` — Cached depot manifest files automatically extracted for your game and DLCs.
  * `appticket.bin` / `eticket.bin` — Raw authorization tickets.

### Stats and Achievements
- Enable stats and achievements for unowned games.
- Uses `setStat(appid, "steamid")` to configure which SteamID's achievement data to pull.
- If no `setStat` is configured for an app, OpenSteamTool queries `https://stats.opensteamtool.com/{appid}` when `[stats] enable_api = true` (default).
- Priority: `setStat` > stats API when enabled and valid > hardcoded preset SteamID `76561198028121353`.

### Online Fix
- Add `-onlinefix` to the Steam launch parameters to enable 480-based online play in games that use lobby matchmaking. The current limitation is that only one such game can run at a time.To revert, simply remove -onlinefix from the launch parameters — online play returns to normal on the next launch.

## Future
- Steam Cloud synchronization support.(This is a huge project)

## Usage

### Method 1: Portable Mode (Recommended, using ost-Injector)

Portable mode operates completely independently: **no DLLs are placed in the Steam directory, and the Steam installation folder remains untouched**:

1. Extract the build / release package (containing `ost-Injector.exe`, `OpenSteamTool.dll`, `CreateAutoInjectTask.bat`, `DeleteAutoInjectTask.bat`, `config.ini`, etc.) to any standalone portable directory (e.g. `D:\OpenSteamTool_Portable`).
2. Create a `config/lua/` folder in that directory and place your game/DLC unlock Lua scripts there (e.g. `games.lua`).
3. Choose a launch method:
   - **Manual Launch**: Run `ost-Injector.exe` directly. It will detect or launch Steam and inject `OpenSteamTool.dll` once the Steam UI initializes.
   - **Auto-Inject on Startup**: Right-click `CreateAutoInjectTask.bat` and select "Run as administrator" to create a scheduled logon task. The injector runs quietly in the background (`-watch` mode) and auto-injects whenever Steam starts. To remove the task, right-click and run `DeleteAutoInjectTask.bat` as administrator.
   - **Command Line Modes**: `ost-Injector.exe` supports `-watch` (background daemon) and `-silent` (one-shot silent injection). The default `config.ini` allows customizing the Steam executable path and DLL path.

### Method 2: Standard Mode (DLL Hijacking)

1. Run `build.bat` from the project root to build the project, or download a pre-built Release package.
2. Copy the generated `dwmapi.dll`, `xinput1_4.dll`, and `OpenSteamTool.dll` to your Steam root directory.
3. Create a Lua directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\lua`) and place your Lua scripts there. The DLL will automatically load and execute them.

### Lua Configuration Example
```lua
addappid(1361510) -- unlock game with appid 1361510

addappid(1361511, 0,"5954562e7f5260400040a818bc29b60b335bb690066ff767e20d145a3b6b4af0") -- unlock game with appid 1361511 depotKey is "5954562e7f5260400040a818bc29b60b335bb690066ff767e20d145a3b6b4af0" 

addtoken(1361510,"2764735786934684318") -- add access token ("2764735786934684318") for game with appid 1361510 
-- No Longer Supported:
--pinApp(1361510) -- pin game with appid 1361510 to prevent it from being updated

setManifestid(1361511,"5656605350306673283") -- pin depotid:1361511 manifest_gid:5656605350306673283, size defaults to 0
setManifestid(1361511,"5656605350306673283", 12345678) -- same but with explicit size

setAppTicket(1361510,"0100000000000000...") -- write AppTicket to local store (config/credentials/1361510/AppTicket.bin)
setETicket(1361510,"0100000000000000...")   -- write ETicket to local store (config/credentials/1361510/ETicket.bin)

setStat(1361510, "76561197960287930") -- use the specified SteamID's achievement data for appid 1361510
-- If not configured, the stats API is used when enabled; otherwise default SteamID 76561198028121353 is used.
```

All function names are **case-insensitive**. `setAppTicket`, `setappticket`, `SetAppticket`, `SETAPPTICKET` etc. are all equivalent. The same applies to every registered function (`addAppId`, `AddToken`, `SETManifestid`, etc.).

### Configuration (optional)

Rename `opensteamtool.example.toml` to `opensteamtool.toml` and place it in the Steam root directory (next to `steam.exe`).
If no config file is found, built-in defaults are used — no auto-creation.
The file is watched while Steam is running; valid changes are hot-reloaded without restarting Steam.

```toml
[log]
# Debug build only.  Level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
level = "info"

[manifest]
# Upstream API for depot manifest request codes.  Options: "manifestdex", "opensteamtool", "steamrun", "wudrm"
url = "manifestdex"

# HTTP timeouts for manifest requests (milliseconds)
timeout_resolve_ms = 5000
timeout_connect_ms = 5000
timeout_send_ms    = 10000
timeout_recv_ms    = 10000

[stats]
# Query https://stats.opensteamtool.com/{appid} when no Lua setStat override exists.
# Priority: setStat > stats API > hardcoded preset SteamID.
enable_api = true

# Additional Lua config directories (optional).
# Files are loaded after the default <Steam>/config/lua folder.
# The default folder is always loaded last so user files take priority.
[lua]
paths = []

[cloud]
# Optional Steam Cloud save redirection for unlocked ("lua") games, powered by
# CloudRedirect (https://github.com/Selectively11/CloudRedirect).
# When enabled, OpenSteamTool loads cloud_redirect.dll inside Steam, registers
# every addappid() game as a redirected app, and routes their Steam Cloud RPCs
# through CloudRedirect's cloud-save engine.
#
# Provider sign-in (Google Drive / OneDrive / local folder) is still done through
# CloudRedirect's own companion app — OpenSteamTool only hosts the DLL.
enabled = false
# Path to cloud_redirect.dll. Absolute, or relative to the Steam root directory.
# Defaults to "<Steam>/cloud_redirect.dll" when unset.
# library = "cloud_redirect.dll"

[inject]
# Optional DLL injection into game processes. See "Third-party DLL injection" below.
# [[inject]]
# path = "{your_dll}.dll"

# Optional metadata mirror. See "Steam version compatibility" below.
[remote]
# url_template = "https://your.server/{channel}/{component}/{sha256}.toml"
```

### Third-party DLL injection

OpenSteamTool can load third-party DLLs into game processes. Each `[[inject]]` entry is injected when every condition it sets matches the launch; matching entries are injected in listed order.

| Key | Explanation |
|-----|---------|
| `path` | DLL to load. A bare file name resolves next to `steam.exe`; an absolute path is used as-is. Missing files are skipped. |
| `when_cmdline` | Substring that must appear in the launch command line. Omit to match any. |
| `when_appids` | AppIds to restrict to. Omit/leave empty to match any. |
| `all_games` | `false` (default) injects only into games added by the manifest; `true` injects into every game you launch. |

```toml
[[inject]]
path = "OnlineFix.dll"
when_cmdline = "-onlinefix"
```

### Manifest via Lua

Two manifest code functions are supported:

#### `fetch_manifest_code(gid)`

Basic function that receives only the manifest GID.

#### `fetch_manifest_code_ex(app_id, depot_id, gid)` *(recommended)*

Extended function that receives `app_id`, `depot_id`, and `gid`. Allows constructing API endpoints that require app identification.

The C++ runtime provides two Lua helpers:

| Function | Signature | Returns |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `http_get`  | `http_get(url [, headers])`       | `body, status_code` |
| `http_post` | `http_post(url, body [, headers])` | `body, status_code` |

`headers` is an optional table: `{["Key"]="Value", ...}`.

### Steam version compatibility

OpenSteamTool no longer ships byte-pattern signatures inside the DLL. Instead, on each launch it computes the SHA-256 of `steamclient64.dll` and `steamui.dll` on disk and looks up a matching pattern file from the upstream tracker at [`OpenSteam001/steam-monitor`](https://github.com/OpenSteam001/steam-monitor) (`pattern` branch).

Lookup order (every launch):

1. **GitHub raw** — `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSteam001/steam-monitor/pattern/...`. Canonical source.
2. **jsDelivr CDN** — automatic fallback if GitHub raw is unreachable (connection refused / timeout / 5xx). No configuration required. Useful in regions where `raw.githubusercontent.com` is blocked but jsDelivr is reachable (e.g. mainland China).
3. **Local cache** — `<Steam>\opensteamtool\pattern\<subdir>\<sha256>.toml`. Used **only** when remote is unreachable. The cache is overwritten after every successful remote fetch.

Remote is consulted on every launch so users automatically pick up upstream re-publications (e.g. the bot adding a new signature, or fixing an existing one) without having to clear any cache.

If a step returns **HTTP 404** the mirror loop stops immediately — all mirrors serve the same content, so a 404 means the upstream bot has not yet published a TOML for this Steam build. The code then falls back to the local cache if one exists; otherwise a one-shot popup appears with the unmatched DLL name, its SHA-256, the expected cache path, and the upstream URL. Only the hooks tied to that DLL are disabled — the rest of OpenSteamTool keeps working.

You can also drop a pattern TOML into the cache directory manually if you know the layout for a given build; the file name must be `<sha256>.toml`. The cache fallback will pick it up the next time remote is unreachable.

> A short outbound HTTPS request is performed at every launch (one per DLL: `steamclient64.dll`, `steamui.dll`). The downloaded bodies are tiny (~10 KB each) and the work runs on a worker thread, so it never blocks Steam's loader.

#### Using a different mirror

For most users, the built-in **GitHub -> jsDelivr** fallback is enough. To use a private mirror or intranet server, configure a full URL template. A custom mirror replaces the built-in remote sources; local cache fallback remains available.

The template must include `{channel}`, `{component}`, and `{sha256}`. Channels currently used are `pattern` and `ipc`.

```toml
[remote]
url_template = "https://your.server/{channel}/{component}/{sha256}.toml"
# url_template = "https://fast.jsdelivr.net/gh/OpenSteam001/steam-monitor@{channel}/{component}/{sha256}.toml"
```

### Debug logging

Debug builds write per-module log files under `<Steam>/opensteamtool/`:
